This directory contains files you can use to monitor OpenQA.

  # dnf install fedora-messaging

For each of the files below, search for REPLACEME and replace
as appropriate, then copy:

  podman.py
  podman.toml   - put these in ~/.config/fedora-messaging/
  ^^^^^^^^^^^<--- edited version of /etc/fedora-messaging/fedora.toml

  podman-openqa.service - put in ~/.config/systemd/user

Then:

    $ systemctl --user daemon-reload
    $ systemctl --user start podman-openqa.service

You will get email any time a message comes in where test_type
contains "podman" and result is not "passed". Email will
contain a link at the top, click on that to see openqa results.

You can check that it's working by looking in /var/tmp/fedmsg-podman
or whatever you set "path" to. Messages come in every few minutes.

Useful links. Or, they were useful to me at the time I set all this up
a year ago. YMMV.
